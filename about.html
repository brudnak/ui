          Choose <span class="educell-spacing">Educell</span> for all students
        </h2>
        <p>
          Providing a quality education and stable environment to allow children
          to thrive is no easy task. For many social workers, teachers, and
          other care providers who reside in remote or low income areas this is
          even more complicated. Fewer resources means fewer chances to share
          information and provide the best opportunities for each student in a
          timely fashion.
        </p>
        <p>
          Wouldn’t it be wonderful if there was a way to bridge this gap and
          bring effective communication and data sharing abilites to students
          from all walks of life? Well, now there is! With EduCell teachers,
          administrative staff, and social workers can share information about a
          specific student in order to keep the communication lines open and
          provide the very best outcomes for all children.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-header">So what does EduCell do</h2>
        <p>
          Well, to put it simply it provides an organized list of all students,
          case workers, and educational staff. Users can access information
          about a student’s age, grade, background story, current unresolved
          issues, and suggestions for success. If you are a school admin you
          will have the ability to add and delete students to keep your list up
          to date. Caseworkers and staff will be able to add notes, send
          messages, and provide suggestions for each student.
        </p>
        <h2 class="h2-header">EduCell is easy to use</h2>
        <p>
          After you log in using your personal credentials you will be able to
          view the list by age, grade, or individual students. Student pictures
          will help put a name to a face and ensure that notes are being added
          to the correct casefile.Using the very simple buttons you can easily
          add or delete your own notes as well as view the notes of others. When
          you have finished updating the case files simply use the log out
          button to ensure student confidentiality.
